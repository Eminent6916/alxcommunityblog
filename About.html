	<h1> ABOUT US </h1> 
	<p> Alx Community Blog is a team project created in line with the ALX software engineering program curriculum. 
	This project is being designed and built by a three member team of students at the alx software engineering program. 
 	The project is aimed at providing the Alx community an alternative communication channel alongside the existing information platform known as slack. 
	The blog will provide alx students information concerning current events happening in the software engineering program, learn new concepts and ideas while discussing ongoing projects And ultimately creating a platform for interaction, connectivity and communal collaborations amongst the Alx family as a whole.
